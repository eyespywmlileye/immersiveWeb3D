RFP Background: 

A Virtual Innovation Lab is a digital space in which an entire online crowd can remotely collaborate to experiment with new ideas and test new solutions to create new value.
The primary function of a Multimedia innovation center (MMIC) is to have a virtual environment where people can engage with innovation and collaborate in solving challenges. A basic MMIC should include interactive and adaptable/responsive design and allow for problem-solving and idea piloting. As well as support Content Management and have a Knowledge Repository for case studies.

The implementation of MMIC is more than just choosing the right virtual software. In the implementation of the MMIC, the success of the virtual centre is highly dependent on users being able to utilise the functionality of the centre.
